# Ultrasound-parking-sensor-with-RS232-connectivity-Asynchronous-

A parking sensor based on ultrasound was implemented, which communicates with a master terminal, a computer, for sending data and receiving configuration frames, using the RS232 communication protocol. In this project an ATmega32 microcontroller was used to handle the ultrasound signals, RS232 serial communication and FreeRTOS for parallel tasks.
